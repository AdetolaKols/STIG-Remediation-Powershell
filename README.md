# STIG Remediation

## üõ°Ô∏è What is a DISA STIG?

A **DISA STIG (Security Technical Implementation Guide)** is a configuration standard developed by the 
Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to enhance the security of information systems within the Department 
of Defense (DoD). STIGs provide specific guidelines and technical controls that systems must follow to reduce 
vulnerabilities and ensure secure configurations.

These benchmarks serve a critical role in compliance, helping organizations ensure their systems meet rigorous 
security requirements defined by the DoD. While originally intended for federal use, they are widely adopted in 
private sector environments for strengthening cybersecurity postures.
